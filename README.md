Real-Time Multiplayer Ping Pong Game

This project is a simple two-player Ping Pong game built with a Node.js (TypeScript) backend and a React (TypeScript) frontend, featuring real-time communication using Socket.IO.

üéÆ Game Overview
Two players connect to a game session, each controlling a paddle on their screen. The objective is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points. The first player to reach the winning score - 5 points - wins the match!

To access the game and play:
1. Download or clone the repository
If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up and run the backend server
The backend server manages game logic and real-time communication.

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

You should see a message in your terminal like: Server with Socket.IO is running on http://localhost:3001. Keep this terminal window open.

3. Set up and run the frontend application

# Open a NEW terminal window or tab
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

This should automatically open the game in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000. If not, open this URL manually.
